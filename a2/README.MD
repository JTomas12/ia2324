## Supervised Learning ([A2](a2))

**Theme chosen:** Glioma Grading Clinical and Mutation Features

**Description:** This assignment involves applying supervised learning algorithms to classify examples based on a target concept. It includes an exploratory data analysis, employing various learning algorithms, and comparing them using evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and accuracy. At least three algorithms such as Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and K-NN are to be used, with results presented using tables or plots.


## How to run

Firstly you need to have installed the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install them by running the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

After installing the libraries, you can run all the cells in the Jupyter Notebook by clicking on the "Run All" button. If you want to run each model separately, you can run the cells one by one. When doing this, make sure the dataset and imports are loaded by running the first 2 cells and the cell in the section ```Separating data into training and test set```. 
Note that the dataset is already included in the repository, so you don't need to download it.
